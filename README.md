# Registration Form Application

This is a registration form application built with the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework, using the [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) library and styled with [Ant Design](https://ant.design/). This application demonstrates a robust user registration process, including field validations and data handling.

## Project Overview

The `RegistrationForm` component handles user inputs for fields such as username, email, password, password confirmation, date of birth, gender, and phone number. It ensures that all data entered meets specific criteria (e.g., email format, password requirements) before allowing a user to submit the form. Validation errors are displayed clearly beneath each field to guide the user towards successful form completion.

Upon submission, if all fields are correctly filled, the form data is displayed in a JSON format within a modal window, confirming the registration success. This project aims to provide a user-friendly, interactive registration experience while employing best practices in form handling and validation with `react-hook-form`.
